		<p> My name is Maya. I am a freshman at Northeastern and am currently a Chemistry major. I'm in this class because I'm still trying to figure out what I like/want to do in the future and this was one of the only classes that fit into my schedule that had space. I am excited to learn about web design and basic programming because I've never done anything like this before. I am interested in the design/arts field and wanted to learn about computer science, so this class will hopefully help with both of those things. A few of my hobbies outside of academics include dance and photography. I'm pretty much like every college student and like to watch netflix and hang out with friends in my free time. </p>
