		<h1>About Me</h1>
		<p> My name is Maya and Iâ€™m from California. I am a freshman at Northeastern and am currently a Chemistry major. I choose to take this class because I am still unsure of what I want to do and taking this class allowed me to explore the various types of classes outside of my required science/math classes. In addition to science my other area of interest is in the arts/design field. A few of my hobbies outside of academics include dance and photography. </p>
