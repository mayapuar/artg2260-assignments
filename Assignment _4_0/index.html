  	<p>The idea for the game is to have an object that is controlled by the mouse location and you have to move left and right to catch the raindrops in a desert. I still need to figure out how to call the drops based on a time interval, and also make it so that the score counts up from eachtime the drop hits the bucket. Also going to add more styling and figure out the problem I've been having with loading images. </p>
